Verani, omnibus e meis amicis	
antistans mihi milibus trecentis,	
venistine domum ad tuos penates	
fratresque unanimos anumque matrem?	
venisti. o mihi nuntii beati!	
visam te incolumem audiamque Hiberum	
narrantem loca, facta, nationes,	
ut mos est tuus, applicansque collum	
iucundum os oculosque saviabor.	
o quantum est hominum beatiorum,	
quid me laetius est beatiusve?

Veranius, out of all my friends , surpassing for me all three hundred thousand of them, have you come home to your Penates (household gods) and (to your) like-minded/loving brothers and (to your) mother, an old woman/(to your) aged mother? You have come. O blessed news for me! I will see you safe and I will hear you telling (about) the places, deeds (and) tribes of the Spaniards/Iberians, as is your custom, and drawing your neck nearer to me I will kiss your beloved mouth and eyes. O of all men more blessed, who is more glad or more blessed than me?
