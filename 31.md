O quid solutis est beatius curis,	
cum mens onus reponit, ac peregrino	
labore fessi venimus larem ad nostrum	
desideratoque acquiescimus lecto?	
Hoc est quod unumst pro laboribus tantis.	
salve, venusta Sirmio, atque ero gaude	
gaudente; vosque, limpidae lacus undae,	
ridete quidquid est domi cachinnorum!

Oh what is happier than cares released, when the mind puts aside (its) burden and, weary from labor abroad, we (I) have come to our (my) household god, and we (I) rest in the longed for bed? This is what is the one thing in return for such great labors. Hello, O charming Sirmio, and so rejoice in (your) rejoicing master, and you, O Lydian waves of the lake, laugh whatever (of) laughter there is at home.
