Cui dono lepidum novum libellum
arida modo pumice expolitum?
Corneli, tibi: namque tu solebas
meas esse aliquid putare nugas.
Iam tum, cum ausus es unus Italorum
omne aevum tribus explicare cartis . . .
Doctis, Iuppiter, et laboriosis!
Quare habe tibi quidquid hoc libelli—
qualecumque, quod, o patrona virgo,
plus uno maneat perenne saeclo!

To whom do I give this pretty little book
just polished off with dry pumice?
Cornelius, to you: for you were accustomed
to think that my trifles were worth something.
Now then, when you alone of Italians dared
to set forth every age in three volumes ...
Learned, by Jupiter, and troublesome!
Therefore have for yourself whatever of this little book -
o patroness Virgin, let it remain for more than one century.
