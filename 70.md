Nulli se dicit mulier mea nubere malle
quam mihi, non si se Iuppiter ipse petat.
Dicit: sed mulier cupido quod dicit amanti,
in vento et rapida scribere oportet aqua.

My woman says that she prefers to marry no one rather than me, not if Jupiter himself should ask her. She says: but it is proper to write that which a woman says to (her) eager lover on the wind and swift water.
