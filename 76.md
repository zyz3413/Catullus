Quin tu animo offirmas atque istinc teque reducis,

et dis invitis desinis esse miser?
Difficile est longum subito deponere amorem;

difficile est, verum hoc qua lubet efficias.
Una salus haec est, hoc est tibi pervincendum;

hoc facias, sive id non pote sive pote.
O di, si vestrum est misereri, aut si quibus umquam

extremam iam ipsa in morte tulistis opem,
me miserum aspicite et, si vitam puriter egi,

eripite hanc pestem perniciemque mihi,
quae mihi subrepens imos ut torpor in artus

expulit ex omni pectore laetitias.

Why don't you become firm in your heart, and also bring yourself back from that point, and, since the gods are unwilling, cease to be wretched? It is difficult suddenly to put aside a long love; it is difficult, but do it, however it is pleasing. This is your one salvation; this must be conquered by you; do this, whether it's possible or not possible.

O gods, if it is yours to pity, or if you have ever brought final aid to those already in death itself, look at wretched me and, if I have lived life purely, snatch this plague and destruction from me, which creeping into my limbs like a numbness has driven out joys from my entire heart.
