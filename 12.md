Marrūcīne Asinī, manū sinistrā
nōn bellē ūteris: in iocō atque vīnō
tollis lintea neglegentiōrum.
Hoc salsum esse putās? Fugit tē, inepte:
quamvīs sordida rēs et invenusta est.
Nōn crēdis mihi? Crēde Polliōnī
frātrī, quī tua fūrta vel talentō
mūtārī velit—est enim lepōrum
differtus puer ac facētiārum.

Asinius Marrucinus, you do not use (your) left hand nicely, in joking and in wine you pick up the napkins of more careless people. Do you think this is clever? It escapes you, foolish one; it is a matter tacky as can be and unattractive. You don't believe me? Believe Pollio, your brother, who would want your theft to be changed for even a talent; for he is a boy stuffed with charm and wit.
