Nulla potest mulier tantum se dicere amatam
vere, quantum a e Lesbia amata mea est.
Nulla fides ullo fuit umquam foedere tanta,
quanta in amore tuo ex parte reperta mea est.

No woman is able to say that she has been loved truly as much as my Lesbia has been loved by me. No loyalty in any pact has ever been as great as has been found in love for you on my part.
