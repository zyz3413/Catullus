Passer, deliciae meae puellae,
quicum ludere, quem in sinu tenere,
cui primum digitum dare appetenti
et acris solet incitare morsus,
cum desiderio meo nitenti
carum nescio quid lubet iocari
et solaciolum sui doloris,
credo ut tum gravis acquiescat ardor:
tecum ludere sicut ipsa possem
et tristis animi levare curas!

Sparrow, pet of my girl,
with whom she is accustomed to play, with whom to hold in her lap,
to whom attacking to give her fingertip 
and to incite sharp bites,
when it is pleasing to my shining desire
to make some dear joke
and solace from her grief,
I believe as then her pain is relieved:
may I be able to play with you as she does,
and lighten the sad cares of my heart!
