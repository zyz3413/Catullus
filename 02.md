Passer, deliciae meae puellae,
quicum ludere, quem in sinu tenere,
cui primum digitum dare appetenti
et acris solet incitare morsus,
cum desiderio meo nitenti
carum nescio quid lubet iocari
et solaciolum sui doloris,
credo ut tum gravis acquiescat ardor:
tecum ludere sicut ipsa possem
et tristis animi levare curas!

Sparrow, pet of my girl,
with whom she is accustomed to play, with whom (she is accustomed) to hold in her lap,
to whom attacking (she is accustomed) to give her fingertip 
and to incite sharp bites,
when it is pleasant for my shining desire
to make some dear joke
and solace from her grief,
I suppose, so that then her weighty heat may become quiet:
may I be able to play with you as she does,
and lighten the sad cares of my heart!
